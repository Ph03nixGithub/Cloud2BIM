# Cloud2BIM 
Cloud2BIM automates the Scan-to-BIM process by converting point clouds into 3D parametric entities.  It employs a segmentation algorithm that utilizes point cloud density analysis, augmented by image and morphological operations. This allows the software to precisely extract the geometry of building elements such as slabs, walls, windows, and doors. The output is generated in IFC format, ensuring compatibility with other OpenBIM tools. The primary motivation for this software is to streamline and enhance decision-making at the end of a building's lifecycle, leading to more efficient material use during demolition or deconstruction.
